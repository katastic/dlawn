	- items: hacking. bombs. medkit.

	- new: SWIMMING
	- hacking, talking?, brute force breakin through doors/windows/etc.
	- sneak in.
	
	- use a civilian as a HOSTAGE and lead them around.
		- different areas, and different levels, have Rules of Engagement levels
		from "completely ignore hostile acts" all the way to "shoot on sight"
			- Full ignore
			- Aggrevated by shots / hacking sighting
			- Aggrevated by trespassing
			- Shoot on sight
			
		or even a set of qualifiers of any combination.
	
for any particular level, get XP points for beating it multiple ways just like Styx: Master of Shadows 
	- assault run. complete the level normally. +avoid civilian casualities. (or is that pacifist)
	- pacifist run. 
	- ghost run. 
	
	or literally:
		skill objectives + optional objectives.
	
	- assault
		- don't kill anyone
		- don't lose X health
		- TIME.
	- breacher
		- uses explosives and other devices to break through windows, doors, WALLS, etc.
	- hacker
		- uses computers to subvert automated defenses
		- steal data
	- thief 
		- don't kill anyone
		- steal things
		- don't get seen
		- limited breaching

	if we intend to do CO-OP then we need to LIMIT the amount of resource usage somehow, like Monaco with limited use items. 
	Or force everyone to be the same class. The idea is, whether it's 1 or 4 players, there's the same amount of total "kit" 
	item money, so we can easily tweak level difficulty/design to be balanced.
		[levels can specify lootkit too, just be ware that modders aren't exactly great at balance.]
	
		- 1 guy can breach X of Y doors, so he has to make a CHOICE which ones you care about. Do you bypass this section, when a harder section may be ahead?
		- 4 guys can breach the same amount of X doors, by splitting the charges between them. They just can do different ordering.
		
			think using flashbangs/stun grenades to bypass sections. They're temporary, and limited.
		
		
	--> How do we ALARMS and other AI when there's multiple players?
		- it has to reset (cooldown?) somehow otherwise the game is blown immediately when someone messes up a single task.
		- we could do some sort of "only way to stop alarm, is go to an ALARM STATION and hit it" like crusader no remorse.
			- so there is a PENALTY for screwing up, but its only a set back. However, in a really hard section it could be annoying to constantly backtrack.
			- dont forget LOCKDOWN gates/doors/windows/etc when alarms hit which force you to either use more breaching kit, or undo the alarm

obviously full Steam workshop support for new levels and campaigns. No idea if you can add 3rd party enemies.
