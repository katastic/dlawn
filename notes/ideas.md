 - rock-paper-scissor ship class based system but with skill allowing beating wrong classes.
 - planetary battle system like Army Commander (or whatever it is) MS-DOS game
	- drop tanks to defeat infantry. drop X to kill tanks. drop infantry to defeat X.
	- but doesn't that become tedious?
	
 - PvE gameplay instead of PvP for more longevity?
 - actual large worlds/asteroids you can go into (maps) like Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime?
